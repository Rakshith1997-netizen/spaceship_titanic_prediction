# 🚀 Kaggle: Spaceship Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome aboard the ML starship! This repository contains my solution for the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) Kaggle competition — where the goal is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension 🌀.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `spaceship.ipynb` | Main notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and prediction. |
| `train.csv` | Training dataset provided by Kaggle. |
| `test.csv` | Test dataset to make predictions on. |
| `sample_submission.csv` | Kaggle’s sample submission file. |
| `predictions.csv` | My model’s output predictions (ready for submission). |
| `README.md` | You're reading it! 🚀 |

## 🧠 What’s Inside the Notebook?
- 🧼 Data Cleaning (handling missing values, feature engineering)
- 📊 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations)
- 🧪 Model Training (tried different models & hyperparameters)
- 📈 Predictions & Submission creation

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spaceship-titanic.git
